- Localization: EKF fusion (IMU, odom, optional GNSS)
- Mapping: local & global map modules
- Planning: global and local planners with dynamic replanning
- Obstacle avoidance: multi-camera fused costmap
- Drone interface: mission commands & state exchange
- Runs in simulation (Gazebo) and on actual robot
